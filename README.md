# AngularJS-Coursera
This is the project repo for the Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS offered by Hong Kong University through Coursera.

This course concentrated mainly on Javascript based front-end frameworks, and in particular, AngularJS. I learned about the model view controller (MVC) design-pattern in the context of AngularJS. The class introduced me to various aspects of AngularJS including two-way data binding and angular directives and filters followed by an introduction to angular controllers and scopes.<br><br>
Through this course I was able to build off of my previous experience with front end web development and gain a valuable introduction to AngularJS. Starter code was provided through the course. <br><br>
